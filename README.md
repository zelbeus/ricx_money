RicX Money - RedEM:RP basic money transfer script

Players can open the menu with the default control key U, and they can choose different size of money stacks. If they have enough money upon choosing one of the stack, they will get an inventory item with the choosen amount and they loose that money. They can drop or use the stack later to get back the money or to give it someone else.
